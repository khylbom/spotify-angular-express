--Readme document for Katelyn Hylbom, khylbom@uci.edu, 66004992, Assignment Group #57--

1. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    Many, many, many, many hours. Completing this assignment has literally been a full time job. 
    While I did opt to do this assignment without a partner, I would like to offer the feedback that
        this assignment should be shortened and less complex. This class is NOT specifically a 
        "project course", as defined by what counts towards graduation requirements. However, this
        course so far has required far more project-intensive hours than ANY project course I have
        taken so far (including the 2-quarter senior capstone project course, INF191A/B).

2. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
    https://angular.io/guide/component-interaction#pass-data-from-parent-to-child-with-input-binding


3. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    Read some of the questions/replies about the assignment on Slack, and contributed on a few.
    Briefly talked with Cheri Nadell about handling the callback parameter for writeTokenFile() who
        helped by giving me the hint that we were supposed to use an anonymous function for the callback.


4. Did you add any bonus features to your submission? If so, what are they and how should we see them?



5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
